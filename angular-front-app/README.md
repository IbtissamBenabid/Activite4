Angular front app placeholder

This folder will contain the Angular application for the Activite4 project.
This folder contains a minimal single-page app (not a full Angular project) for demonstration.

Quick start (Windows PowerShell):

1. From this folder run:

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
```

2. Open http://localhost:5173 and click "Load Keynotes" or "Load Conferences" (the front calls the Gateway at http://localhost:8081).

Notes:
- This is a minimal Vite-based SPA used to demonstrate frontend/back-end integration without requiring Angular CLI.
- Replace with a true Angular scaffold (`ng new`) if you need a full Angular app.
